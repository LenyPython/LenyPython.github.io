# My personal portfolio

Those are components which I use in Storyblok CMS to create a whole portfolio page.

### Structure

In src directory you'll find directories which hold components specific to layout or theme.
In Global there will be General usage blocks or components.

Block - is a component which retrieves content from Storyblock CMS
Component - is a standalone component ex. button which does not need any content provided.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
