### My personal portfolio

Those are components which I use in Storyblok CMS to create a whole portfolio page. The code/components/bloks are available here, but to get content you are required to have access to CMS to download content to see the page in whole.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
